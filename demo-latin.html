<a name="css-document-anatomy" class="anchor" href="#css-document-anatomy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CSS Document Anatomy</h2>

<p>No matter the document, we must always try and keep a common formatting. This
means consistent commenting, consistent syntax and consistent naming.</p>

<h3>
<a name="general" class="anchor" href="#general"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General</h3>

<p>Limit your stylesheets to a maximum 80 character width where possible.
Exceptions may be gradient syntax and URLs in comments. That’s fine, there’s
nothing we can do about that.</p>

<p>I prefer four (4) space indents over tabs and write multi-line CSS.</p>

<h3>
<a name="one-file-vs-many-files" class="anchor" href="#one-file-vs-many-files"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One file vs. many files</h3>

<p>Some people prefer to work with single, large files. This is fine, and by
sticking to the following guidelines you’ll encounter no problems. Since moving
to Sass I have started sharding my stylesheets out into lots of tiny includes.
This too is fine… Whichever method you choose, the following rules and
guidelines apply. The only notable difference is with regards our table of
contents and our section titles. Read on for further explanation…</p>

<h3>
<a name="table-of-contents" class="anchor" href="#table-of-contents"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Table of contents</h3>

<p>At the top of stylesheets, I maintain a table of contents which will detail the
sections contained in the document, for example:</p>

<pre><code>/*------------------------------------*\
    $CONTENTS
\*------------------------------------*/
/**
 * CONTENTS............You’re reading it!
 * RESET...............Set our reset defaults
 * FONT-FACE...........Import brand font files
 */
</code></pre>

<p>This will tell the next developer(s) exactly what they can expect to find in
this file. Each item in the table of contents maps directly to a section title.</p>

<p>If you are working in one big stylesheet, the corresponding section will also be
in that file. If you are working across multiple files then each item in the
table of contents will map to an include which pulls that section in.</p>

<h3>
<a name="section-titles" class="anchor" href="#section-titles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section titles</h3>

<p>The table of contents would be of no use unless it had corresponding section
titles. Denote a section thus:</p>

<pre><code>/*------------------------------------*\
    $RESET
\*------------------------------------*/
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$</code> prefixing the name of the section allows us to run a find ([Cmd|Ctrl]+F)
for <code>$[SECTION-NAME]</code> and <strong>limit our search scope to section titles only</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are working in one large stylesheet, you leave five (5) carriage returns
between each section, thus:</p>

<pre><code>/*------------------------------------*\
    $RESET
\*------------------------------------*/
[Our
reset
styles]





/*------------------------------------*\
    $FONT-FACE
\*------------------------------------*/
</code></pre>

<p>This large chunk of whitespace is quickly noticeable when scrolling quickly
through larger files.</p>

<p>If you are working across multiple, included stylesheets, start each of those
files with a section title and there is no need for any carriage returns.</p>

<h2>
<a name="source-order" class="anchor" href="#source-order"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Source order</h2>

<p>Try and write stylesheets in specificity order. This ensures that you take full
advantage of inheritance and CSS’ first <i>C</i>; the cascade.</p>

<p>A well ordered stylesheet will be ordered something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Reset</strong> – ground zero.</li>
<li>
<strong>Elements</strong> – unclassed <code>h1</code>, unclassed <code>ul</code> etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Objects and abstractions</strong> — generic, underlying design patterns.</li>
<li>
<strong>Components</strong> – full components constructed from objects and their
extensions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Style trumps</strong> – error states etc.</li>
</ol><p>This means that—as you go down the document—each section builds upon and
inherits sensibly from the previous one(s). There should be less undoing of
styles, less specificity problems and all-round better architected stylesheets.</p>

<p>For further reading I cannot recommend Jonathan Snook’s
<a href="http://smacss.com">SMACSS</a> highly enough.</p>

<h2>
<a name="anatomy-of-rulesets" class="anchor" href="#anatomy-of-rulesets"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Anatomy of rulesets</h2>

<pre><code>[selector]{
    [property]:[value];
    [&lt;- Declaration -&gt;]
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a number of standards when structuring rulesets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use hyphen delimited class names (except for BEM notation,
<a href="#naming-conventions">see below</a>)</li>
<li>4 space indented</li>
<li>Multi-line</li>
<li>Declarations in relevance (NOT alphabetical) order</li>
<li>Indent vendor prefixed declarations so that their values are aligned</li>
<li>Indent our rulesets to mirror the DOM</li>
<li>Always include the final semi-colon in a ruleset</li>
</ul><p>A brief example:</p>

<pre><code>.widget{
    padding:10px;
    border:1px solid #BADA55;
    background-color:#C0FFEE;
    -webkit-border-radius:4px;
       -moz-border-radius:4px;
            border-radius:4px;
}
    .widget-heading{
        font-size:1.5rem;
        line-height:1;
        font-weight:bold;
        color:#BADA55;
        margin-right:-10px;
        margin-left: -10px;
        padding:0.25em;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see that <code>.widget-heading</code> must be a child of <code>.widget</code> as we have
indented the <code>.widget-heading</code> ruleset one level deeper than <code>.widget</code>. This is
useful information to developers that can now be gleaned just by a glance at the
indentation of our rulesets.</p>

<p>We can also see that <code>.widget-heading</code>’s declarations are ordered by their
relevance; <code>.widget-heading</code> must be a textual element so we begin with our
text rules, followed by everything else.</p>

<p>One exception to our multi-line rule might be in cases of the following:</p>

<pre><code>.t10    { width:10% }
.t20    { width:20% }
.t25    { width:25% }       /* 1/4 */
.t30    { width:30% }
.t33    { width:33.333% }   /* 1/3 */
.t40    { width:40% }
.t50    { width:50% }       /* 1/2 */
.t60    { width:60% }
.t66    { width:66.666% }   /* 2/3 */
.t70    { width:70% }
.t75    { width:75% }       /* 3/4*/
.t80    { width:80% }
.t90    { width:90% }
</code></pre>

<p>In this example (from <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/blob/master/inuit.css/partials/base/_tables.scss#L88">inuit.css’s table grid system</a>)
it makes more sense to single-line our CSS.</p>

<h2>
<a name="naming-conventions" class="anchor" href="#naming-conventions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Naming conventions</h2>

<p>For the most part I simply use hyphen delimited classes (e.g. <code>.foo-bar</code>, not
<code>.foo_bar</code> or <code>.fooBar</code>), however in certain circumstances I use BEM (Block,
Element, Modifier) notation.</p>

<p>BEM is a methodology for naming
and classifying CSS selectors in a way to make them a lot more strict,
transparent and informative.</p>

<p>The naming convention follows this pattern:</p>

<pre><code>.block{}
.block__element{}
.block--modifier{}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
<code>.block</code> represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.</li>
<li>
<code>.block__element</code> represents a descendent of <code>.block</code> that helps form <code>.block</code>
as a whole.</li>
<li>
<code>.block--modifier</code> represents a different state or version of <code>.block</code>.</li>
</ul><p>An <strong>analogy</strong> of how BEM classes work might be:</p>

<pre><code>.person{}
.person--woman{}
    .person__hand{}
    .person__hand--left{}
    .person__hand--right{}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see that the basic object we’re describing is a person, and that a
different type of person might be a woman. We can also see that people have
hands; these are sub-parts of people, and there are different variations,
like left and right.</p>

<p>We can now namespace our selectors based on their base objects and we can also
communicate what job the selector does; is it a sub-component (<code>__</code>) or a
variation (<code>--</code>)?</p>

<p>So, <code>.page-wrapper</code> is a standalone selector; it doesn’t form part of an
abstraction or a component and as such it named correctly. <code>.widget-heading</code>,
however, <em>is</em> related to a component; it is a child of the <code>.widget</code> construct
so we would rename this class <code>.widget__heading</code>.</p>

<p>BEM looks a little uglier, and is a lot more verbose, but it grants us a lot of
power in that we can glean the functions and relationships of elements from
their classes alone. Also, BEM syntax will typically compress (gzip) very well
as compression favours/works well with repetition.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you need to use BEM or not, always ensure classes are
sensibly named; keep them as short as possible but as long as necessary. Ensure
any objects or abstractions are very vaguely named (e.g. <code>.ui-list</code>, <code>.media</code>)
to allow for greater reuse. Extensions of objects should be much more explicitly
named (e.g. <code>.user-avatar-link</code>). Don’t worry about the amount or length of
classes; gzip will compress well written code <em>incredibly</em> well.</p>

<h3>
<a name="classes-in-html" class="anchor" href="#classes-in-html"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classes in HTML</h3>

<p>In a bid to make things easier to read, separate classes in your HTML with two
(2) spaces, thus:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="foo--bar  bar__baz"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This increased whitespace should hopefully allow for easier spotting and reading
of multiple classes.</p>

<h3>
<a name="js-hooks" class="anchor" href="#js-hooks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JS hooks</h3>

<p><strong>Never use a CSS <em>styling</em> class as a JavaScript hook.</strong> Attaching JS behaviour
to a styling class means that we can never have one without the other.</p>

<p>If you need to bind to some markup use a JS specific CSS class. This is simply a
class namespaced with <code>.js-</code>, e.g. <code>.js-toggle</code>, <code>.js-drag-and-drop</code>. This means
that we can attach both JS and CSS to classes in our markup but there will never
be any troublesome overlap.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;th class="is-sortable  js-is-sortable"&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above markup holds two classes; one to which you can attach some styling for
sortable table columns and another which allows you to add the sorting
functionality.</p>

<h3>
<a name="internationalisation" class="anchor" href="#internationalisation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internationalisation</h3>

<p>Despite being a British developer—and spending all my life writing <i>colour</i>
instead of <i>color</i>—I feel that, for the sake of consistency, it is better
to always use US-English in CSS. CSS, as with most (if not all) other languages,
is written in US-English, so to mix syntax like <code>color:red;</code> with classes like
<code>.colour-picker{}</code> lacks consistency. I have previously suggested and advocated
writing bilingual classes, for example:</p>

<pre><code>.color-picker,
.colour-picker{
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, having recently worked on a very large Sass project where there were
dozens of colour variables (e.g. <code>$brand-color</code>, <code>$highlight-color</code> etc.),
maintaining two versions of each variable soon became tiresome. It also means
twice as much work with things like find and replace.</p>

<p>In the interests of consistency, always name classes and variables in the locale
of the language you are working with.</p>

<h2>
<a name="comments" class="anchor" href="#comments"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comments</h2>

<p>I use a docBlock-esque commenting style which I limit to 80 characters in length:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * This is a docBlock style comment
 *
 * This is a longer description of the comment, describing the code in more
 * detail. We limit these lines to a maximum of 80 characters in length.
 *
 * We can have markup in the comments, and are encouraged to do so:
 *
   &lt;div class=foo&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Lorem&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
 *
 * We do not prefix lines of code with an asterisk as to do so would inhibit
 * copy and paste.
 */
</code></pre>

<p>You should document and comment our code as much as you possibly can, what may
seem or feel transparent and self explanatory to you may not be to another dev.
Write a chunk of code then write about it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="comments-on-steroids" class="anchor" href="#comments-on-steroids"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comments on steroids</h3>

<p>There are a number of more advanced techniques you can employ with regards
comments, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quasi-qualified selectors</li>
<li>Tagging code</li>
<li>Object/extension pointers</li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="quasi-qualified-selectors" class="anchor" href="#quasi-qualified-selectors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quasi-qualified selectors</h4>

<p>You should never qualify your selectors; that is to say, we should never write
<code>ul.nav{}</code> if you can just have <code>.nav</code>. Qualifying selectors decreases selector
performance, inhibits the potential for reusing a class on a different type of
element and it increases the selector’s specificity. These are all things that
should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>However, sometimes it is useful to communicate to the next developer(s) where
you intend a class to be used. Let’s take <code>.product-page</code> for example; this
class sounds as though it would be used on a high-level container, perhaps the
<code>html</code> or <code>body</code> element, but with <code>.product-page</code> alone it is impossible to
tell.</p>

<p>By quasi-qualifying this selector (i.e. commenting out the leading type
selector) we can communicate where we wish to have this class applied, thus:</p>

<pre><code>/*html*/.product-page{}
</code></pre>

<p>We can now see exactly where to apply this class but with none of the
specificity or non-reusability drawbacks.</p>

<p>Other examples might be:</p>

<pre><code>/*ol*/.breadcrumb{}
/*p*/.intro{}
/*ul*/.image-thumbs{}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see where we intend each of these classes to be applied without
actually ever impacting the specificity of the selectors.</p>

<h4>
<a name="tagging-code" class="anchor" href="#tagging-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tagging code</h4>

<p>If you write a new component then leave some tags pertaining to its function in
a comment above it, for example:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * ^navigation ^lists
 */
.nav{}

/**
 * ^grids ^lists ^tables
 */
.matrix{}
</code></pre>

<p>These tags allow other developers to find snippets of code by searching for
function; if a developer needs to work with lists they can run a find for
<code>^lists</code> and find the <code>.nav</code> and <code>.matrix</code> objects (and possibly more).</p>

<h4>
<a name="objectextension-pointers" class="anchor" href="#objectextension-pointers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Object/extension pointers</h4>

<p>When working in an object oriented manner you will often have two chunks of CSS
(one being the skeleton (the object) and the other being the skin (the
extension)) that are very closely related, but that live in very different
places. In order to establish a concrete link between the object and its
extension with use <i>object/extension pointers</i>. These are simply comments
which work thus:</p>

<p>In your base stylesheet:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Extend `.foo` in theme.css
 */
 .foo{}
</code></pre>

<p>In your theme stylesheet:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Extends `.foo` in base.css
 */
 .bar{}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have established a concrete relationship between two very separate
pieces of code.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="writing-css" class="anchor" href="#writing-css"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing CSS</h2>

<p>The previous section dealt with how we structure and form our CSS; they were
very quantifiable rules. The next section is a little more theoretical and deals
with our attitude and approach.</p>

<h2>
<a name="building-new-components" class="anchor" href="#building-new-components"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building new components</h2>

<p>When building a new component write markup <strong>before</strong> CSS. This means you can
visually see which CSS properties are naturally inherited and thus avoid
reapplying redundant styles.</p>

<p>By writing markup first you can focus on data, content and semantics and then
apply only the relevant classes and CSS <em>afterwards</em>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="oocss" class="anchor" href="#oocss"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OOCSS</h2>

<p>I work in an OOCSS manner; I split components into structure (objects) and
skin (extensions). As an <strong>analogy</strong> (note, not example) take the following:</p>

<pre><code>.room{}

.room--kitchen{}
.room--bedroom{}
.room--bathroom{}
</code></pre>

<p>We have several types of room in a house, but they all share similar traits;
they all have floors, ceilings, walls and doors. We can share this information
in an abstracted <code>.room{}</code> class. However we have specific types of room that
are different from the others; a kitchen might have a tiled floor and a bedroom
might have carpets, a bathroom might not have a window but a bedroom most likely
will, each room likely has different coloured walls. OOCSS teaches us to
abstract the shared styles out into a base object and then <em>extend</em> this
information with more specific classes to add the unique treatment(s).</p>

<p>So, instead of building dozens of unique components, try and spot repeated
design patterns across them all and abstract them out into reusable classes;
build these skeletons as base ‘objects’ and then peg classes onto these to
extend their styling for more unique circumstances.</p>

<p>If you have to build a new component split it into structure and skin; build the
structure of the component using very generic classes so that we can reuse that
construct and then use more specific classes to skin it up and add design
treatments.</p>

<h2>
<a name="layout" class="anchor" href="#layout"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Layout</h2>

<p>All components you build should be left totally free of widths; they should
always remain fluid and their widths should be governed by a parent/grid system.</p>

<p>Heights should <strong>never</strong> be be applied to elements. Heights should only be
applied to things which had dimensions <em>before</em> they entered the site (i.e.
images and sprites). Never ever set heights on <code>p</code>s, <code>ul</code>s, <code>div</code>s, anything.
You can often achieve the desired effect with <code>line-height</code> which is far more
flexible.</p>

<p>Grid systems should be thought of as shelves. They contain content but are not
content in themselves. You put up your shelves then fill them with your stuff.
By setting up our grids separately to our components you can move components
around a lot more easily than if they had dimensions applied to them; this makes
our front-ends a lot more adaptable and quick to work with.</p>

<p>You should never apply any styles to a grid item, they are for layout purposes
only. Apply styling to content <em>inside</em> a grid item. Never, under <em>any</em>
circumstances, apply box-model properties to a grid item.</p>

<h2>
<a name="sizing-uis" class="anchor" href="#sizing-uis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sizing UIs</h2>

<p>I use a combination of methods for sizing UIs. Percentages, pixels, ems, rems
and nothing at all.</p>

<p>Grid systems should, ideally, be set in percentages. Because I use grid systems
to govern widths of columns and pages, I can leave components totally free of
any dimensions (as discussed above).</p>

<p>Font sizes I set in rems with a pixel fallback. This gives the accessibility
benefits of ems with the confidence of pixels. Here is a handy Sass mixin to
work out a rem and pixel fallback for you (assuming you set your base font
size in a variable somewhere):</p>

<pre><code>@mixin font-size($font-size){
    font-size:$font-size +px;
    font-size:$font-size / $base-font-size +rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I only use pixels for items whose dimensions were defined before the came into
the site. This includes things like images and sprites whose dimensions are
inherently set absolutely in pixels.</p>

<h3>
<a name="font-sizing" class="anchor" href="#font-sizing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Font sizing</h3>

<p>I define a series of classes akin to a grid system for sizing fonts. These
classes can be used to style type in a double stranded heading hierarchy. For a
full explanation of how this works please refer to my article
<a href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/02/pragmatic-practical-font-sizing-in-css">Pragmatic, practical font-sizing in CSS</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="shorthand" class="anchor" href="#shorthand"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shorthand</h2>

<p><strong>Shorthand CSS needs to be used with caution.</strong></p>

<p>It might be tempting to use declarations like <code>background:red;</code> but in doing so
what you are actually saying is ‘I want no image to scroll, aligned top-left,
repeating X and Y, and a background colour of red’. Nine times out of ten this
won’t cause any issues but that one time it does is annoying enough to warrant
not using such shorthand. Instead use <code>background-color:red;</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, declarations like <code>margin:0;</code> are nice and short, but
<strong>be explicit</strong>. If you actually only really want to affect the margin on
the bottom of an element then it is more appropriate to use <code>margin-bottom:0;</code>.</p>

<p>Be explicit in which properties you set and take care to not inadvertently unset
others with shorthand. E.g. if you only want to remove the bottom margin on an
element then there is no sense in setting all margins to zero with <code>margin:0;</code>.</p>

<p>Shorthand is good, but easily misused.</p>

<h2>
<a name="ids" class="anchor" href="#ids"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IDs</h2>

<p>A quick note on IDs in CSS before we dive into selectors in general.</p>

<p><strong>NEVER use IDs in CSS.</strong></p>

<p>They can be used in your markup for JS and fragment identifiers but use only
classes for styling. You don’t want to see a single ID in any stylesheets!</p>

<p>Classes come with the benefit of being reusable (even if we don’t want to, we
can) and they have a nice, low specificity. Specificity is one of the quickest
ways to run into difficulties in projects and keeping it low at all times is
imperative. An ID is <strong>255</strong> times more specific than a class, so never ever use
them in CSS <em>ever</em>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="selectors" class="anchor" href="#selectors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Selectors</h2>

<p>Keep selectors short, efficient and portable.</p>

<p>Heavily location-based selectors are bad for a number of reasons. For example,
take <code>.sidebar h3 span{}</code>. This selector is too location-based and thus we
cannot move that <code>span</code> outside of a <code>h3</code> outside of <code>.sidebar</code> and maintain
styling.</p>

<p>Selectors which are too long also introduce performance issues; the more checks
in a selector (e.g. <code>.sidebar h3 span</code> has three checks, <code>.content ul p a</code> has
four), the more work the browser has to do.</p>

<p>Make sure styles aren’t dependent on location where possible, and make sure
selectors are nice and short.</p>

<p>Selectors as a whole should be kept short (e.g. one class deep) but the class
names themselves should be as long as they need to be. A class of <code>.user-avatar</code>
is far nicer than <code>.usr-avt</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> classes are neither semantic or insemantic; they are sensible or
insensible! Stop stressing about ‘semantic’ class names and pick something
sensible and futureproof.</p>

<h3>
<a name="over-qualified-selectors" class="anchor" href="#over-qualified-selectors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Over-qualified selectors</h3>

<p>As discussed above, qualified selectors are bad news.</p>

<p>An over-qualified selector is one like <code>div.promo</code>. You could probably get the
same effect from just using <code>.promo</code>. Of course sometimes you will <em>want</em> to
qualify a class with an element (e.g. if you have a generic <code>.error</code> class that
needs to look different when applied to different elements (e.g.
<code>.error{ color:red; }</code> <code>div.error{ padding:14px; }</code>)), but generally avoid it
where possible.</p>

<p>Another example of an over-qualified selector might be <code>ul.nav li a{}</code>. As
above, we can instantly drop the <code>ul</code> and because we know <code>.nav</code> is a list, we
therefore know that any <code>a</code> <em>must</em> be in an <code>li</code>, so we can get <code>ul.nav li a{}</code>
down to just <code>.nav a{}</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="selector-performance" class="anchor" href="#selector-performance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Selector performance</h3>

<p>Whilst it is true that browsers will only ever keep getting faster at rendering
CSS, efficiency is something you could do to keep an eye on. Short, unnested
selectors, not using the universal (<code>*{}</code>) selector as the key selector, and
avoiding more complex CSS3 selectors should help circumvent these problems.</p>

<h2>
<a name="css-selector-intent" class="anchor" href="#css-selector-intent"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CSS selector intent</h2>

<p>Instead of using selectors to drill down the DOM to an element, it is often best
to put a class on the element you explicitly want to style. Let’s take a
specific example with a selector like <code>.header ul{}</code>…</p>

<p>Let’s imagine that <code>ul</code> is indeed the main navigation for our website. It lives
in the header as you might expect and is currently the only <code>ul</code> in there;
<code>.header ul{}</code> will work, but it’s not ideal or advisable. It’s not very future
proof and certainly not explicit enough. As soon as we add another <code>ul</code> to that
header it will adopt the styling of our main nav and the the chances are it
won’t want to. This means we either have to refactor a lot of code <em>or</em> undo a
lot of styling on subsequent <code>ul</code>s in that <code>.header</code> to remove the effects of
the far reaching selector.</p>

<p>Your selector’s intent must match that of your reason for styling something;
ask yourself <strong>‘am I selecting this because it’s a <code>ul</code> inside of <code>.header</code> or
because it is my site’s main nav?’</strong>. The answer to this will determine your
selector.</p>

<p>Make sure your key selector is never an element/type selector or
object/abstraction class. You never really want to see selectors like
<code>.sidebar ul{}</code> or <code>.footer .media{}</code> in our theme stylesheets.</p>

<p>Be explicit; target the element you want to affect, not its parent. Never assume
that markup won’t change. <strong>Write selectors that target what you want, not what
happens to be there already.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="important" class="anchor" href="#important"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>!important</code>
</h2>

<p>It is okay to use <code>!important</code> on helper classes only. To add <code>!important</code>
preemptively is fine, e.g. <code>.error{ color:red!important }</code>, as you know you will
<strong>always</strong> want this rule to take precedence.</p>

<p>Using <code>!important</code> reactively, e.g. to get yourself out of nasty specificity
situations, is not advised. Rework your CSS and try to combat these issues by
refactoring your selectors. Keeping your selectors short and avoiding IDs will
help out here massively.</p>

<h2>
<a name="magic-numbers-and-absolutes" class="anchor" href="#magic-numbers-and-absolutes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Magic numbers and absolutes</h2>

<p>A magic number is a number which is used because ‘it just works’. These are bad
because they rarely work for any real reason and are not usually very
futureproof or flexible/forgiving. They tend to fix symptoms and not problems.</p>

<p>For example, using <code>.dropdown-nav li:hover ul{ top:37px; }</code> to move a dropdown
to the bottom of the nav on hover is bad, as 37px is a magic number. 37px only
works here because in this particular scenario the <code>.dropdown-nav</code> happens to be
37px tall.</p>

<p>Instead you should use <code>.dropdown-nav li:hover ul{ top:100%; }</code> which means no
matter how tall the <code>.dropdown-nav</code> gets, the dropdown will always sit 100% from
the top.</p>

<p>Every time you hard code a number think twice; if you can avoid it by using
keywords or ‘aliases’ (i.e. <code>top:100%</code> to mean ‘all the way from the top’)
or—even better—no measurements at all then you probably should.</p>

<p>Every hard-coded measurement you set is a commitment you might not necessarily
want to keep.</p>

<h2>
<a name="conditional-stylesheets" class="anchor" href="#conditional-stylesheets"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conditional stylesheets</h2>

<p>IE stylesheets can, by and large, be totally avoided. The only time an IE
stylesheet may be required is to circumvent blatant lack of support (e.g. PNG
fixes).</p>

<p>As a general rule, all layout and box-model rules can and <em>will</em> work without an
IE stylesheet if you refactor and rework your CSS. This means you never want to
see <code>&lt;!--[if IE 7]&gt; element{ margin-left:-9px; } &lt; ![endif]--&gt;</code> or other such
CSS that is clearly using arbitrary styling to just ‘make stuff work’.</p>

<h2>
<a name="debugging" class="anchor" href="#debugging"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Debugging</h2>

<p>If you run into a CSS problem <strong>take code away before you start adding more</strong> in
a bid to fix it. The problem exists in CSS that is already written, more CSS
isn’t the right answer!</p>

<p>Delete chunks of markup and CSS until your problem goes away, then you can
determine which part of the code the problem lies in.</p>

<p>It can be tempting to put an <code>overflow:hidden;</code> on something to hide the effects
of a layout quirk, but overflow was probably never the problem; <strong>fix the
problem, not its symptoms.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="preprocessors" class="anchor" href="#preprocessors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preprocessors</h2>

<p>Sass is my preprocessor of choice. <strong>Use it wisely.</strong> Use Sass to make your CSS
more powerful but avoid nesting like the plague! Nest only when it would
actually be necessary in vanilla CSS, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>.header{}
.header .site-nav{}
.header .site-nav li{}
.header .site-nav li a{}
</code></pre>

<p>Would be wholly unnecessary in normal CSS, so the following would be <strong>bad</strong>
Sass:</p>

<pre><code>.header{
    .site-nav{
        li{
            a{}
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to Sass this up you’d write it as:</p>

<pre><code>.header{}
.site-nav{
    li{}
    a{}
}
</code></pre></article>
